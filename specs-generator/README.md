SpecsOverviewGenerator.gs parses a report from HWInfo32 and creates an overview Spreadsheet in the current folder. The reports must be placed in a subfolder called "Specs". Using IFTT, a trigger can be created for executing the script when a new file is dumped in the folder.
DevicesReport.gs collects several reports from different folders and collects all data in one single Spreadsheet. The IDs of the folders must be changed in the script.
